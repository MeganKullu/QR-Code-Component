## My process

-Started with creating an html file then linked my css stylesheet to the html file. Used CSS grid and class selectors to
conform to the design given.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to center a div element and re-inforced my understanding of CSS grid and how to style individual elements.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
